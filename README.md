# phonetic-data-collection-app

See it in action at https://elliotbutterworth.com! (not anymore. under construction)

Planned changes: 
- rewrite of the JavaScript portion to be able to save as .wav in order to avoid conversion
- global configuration file for the whole project, esp. for recording length
- eventually, a configuration file for everything, so that people can use this tool for whatever they want
- rewrite to use pure parselmouth instead of this ancient praat script
